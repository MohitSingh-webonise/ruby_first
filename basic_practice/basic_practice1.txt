#in this file i'm using string1 and string2 so many times these values are:

string1="RUBY parses a file by looking for <br/> one of the special tags that tells it to start interpreting the text as RUBY code. The parser then executes all of the code it finds until it runs into a RUBY closing <br/> tag."


and

string2="RUBY does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used."

	{
		 a="RUBY parses a file by looking for <br/> one of the special tags that tells it to start interpreting the text as RUBY code. The parser then 			    executes all of the code it finds until it runs into a RUBY closing <br/> tag.".split(".").first
		
		 a.reverse!

		 b="RUBY parses a file by looking for <br/> one of the special tags that tells it to start interpreting the text as RUBY code. The parser then 			    executes all of the code it finds until it runs into a RUBY closing <br/> tag.".split(".").last
